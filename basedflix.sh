# if you want to set up the script command manually, here are the steps:

# step 1: generate python venv environment by typing "python3 -m venv venv" in your terminal

# step 2: activate the environment (by typing "source venv/bin/activate") and install 
# modules from the requirements.txt file (by typing "pip install -r requirements.txt")

# step 2.5: deactivate the environment by writing the word "deactivate" and pressing Enter.

# step 2: add a path to .bashrc or use a currently established PATH such as usr/bin
# example: export PATH="$PATH:~/.local/bin"

# step 3: create a file called "basedflix" (no file extension) in your PATH folder 
# and add the following to the file (with the #):
#!/bin/bash

# step 3: add the following to the file (without the #):
#cd to/main/directory/of/downloaded/repo
#source ./venv/bin/activate
#python3 main.py

# step 4: give it execution permissions by typing "sudo chmod u+x basedflix" in your terminal

# step 5: You are done! Enjoy me matey!
